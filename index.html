                    <p>Hi folks, since I‚Äôve decided to take a short break from developing <strong>Project Labrador</strong> (at times I already felt burnt out, so it‚Äôs better to relax for a bit and rethink stuff all over again), it‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to tell you a little bit about the project.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in the <a href="/2020/03/15/introduction/" title="Introduction">Introduction</a>, project was born on <strong>July 26th 2019</strong>. I was at work, waiting for a new project (which came just days after) and began to think: if Unity is scene-based, with no central data storage or manager, how do you keep track of entities and their data between scenes and also how to make it easy to save to a file and load it later? The answer came to me after a short research. Since I never did or had to implement such a system, I started to work on a prototype. I was excited. I finished it in 2 or 3 days.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how it works (please note that this is just my naive approach that seems to be working fine in my case. It has it‚Äôs quirks and pitfalls that you have to be aware of!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach Entity component to the GameObject that you want to keep track of and make sure to set a proper id (generate a new one for new entities or copy id used before).</li>
<li>When the scene is loaded and the Entity Start method is executed, it syncs itself with the GameManager that stores all the entity data (inventory, stats, attributes etc.) that I wanted to be saveable. <em>(NOTE: all the data that won‚Äôt change between scenes (like looks etc.) is not saved to the file. This way it‚Äôs possible to create NPCs that look differently based on some conditions in the game.)</em><ul>
<li>If the data for said Entity are already stored in the GameManager, the Entity component‚Äôs internal data changes to the one in the GameManager.</li>
<li>If data does not exist in the GameManager, component‚Äôs data is copied there and stored for the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If data is stored in the serializable State object in the GameManager, it can be serialized and deserialized with one method.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that‚Äôs it. Incremental entity data storage. This means that each entity component is filled in editor with its <strong>default</strong> values, allowing me to make a prefab of said entity to use in other scenes and ensures that even if we skip the scene where the entity was supposed to be first encountered, data will initialize properly and all the changes to his state will be persisted. Also, after some tweaking I was able to add something I called temporary entity - entity generated in runtime - at the moment it‚Äôs only used for items dropped from inventory, but in the future it will be possible to create some randomly generated enemies and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, this limits some options when it comes to creating scenes: entity instances live in a specific scene and cannot just leave it. They‚Äôre basically stuck, unless I simulate them going into other location and create an entity with their id in the other scene. For this purpose I had to create utility components that show/hide entities based on some conditions. Pretty hacky and limiting, but it should be okay for my purposes. I don‚Äôt expect to be doing that kind of stuff often anyway. Just keep it simple and it‚Äôll work. I hope so at least.</p>
<p>Okay, that‚Äôs about it. This is just a tip of the iceberg that is my RPG framework. Let‚Äôs just hope I won‚Äôt crash into it in the long run üòâ. Bye for now!</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Pawe≈Ç and I‚Äôm a front-end developer in one of many big IT consulting corporations. But after hours I chase my dream of making games. Let me tell you about my pet projects a little bit more.</p>
<p>Way back in time I was a Computer Science student at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, where I met Sebastian Krzyszkowiak (also known as <strong>dos</strong>, check him out at <a href="http://dosowisko.net/" title="" target="">dosowisko.net</a>) who was also into gamedev and wanted to participate in Global Game Jam 2015. So we went there and in a period of 48 hours we created <strong>The Secret of Tremendous Corporation</strong> (check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/380140/The_Secret_of_Tremendous_Corporation/" title="" target="">Steam</a>). Making an adventure game on a game jam seemed like a strange idea, but we did it anyway (the whole process of making it is a topic for another post). We downloaded an open-source adventure game engine called <strong>SLUDGE</strong> and just started working. I wrote most of the plot, dialogues and much of the code. And after stressful two days of work it was time to show it to the public. Even though we didn‚Äôt win any prizes (we landed at the second-to-last place), it felt good. We were fully fledged game developers. After the game jam, Sebastian took it upon himself to finish the game and try to make it to Steam. After a successful Steam Greenlight campaign it was time for final fixes and release. We had a game on Steam!</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple months (first commits in the git repo indicate May of 2015, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was started some time before that), I‚Äôve created a vaporwave-themed jumper-platformer called <strong>ÁßÅ„ÇíË≤∑„ÅÜ: Trouble At Virtual Plaza</strong> that was fully functional and working, but lacked actual content due to my <strong>really</strong> poor GFX skills and lack of motivation. The game itself used <strong>Phaser</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong> and it introduced me to the wonderful world of HTML5 and modern Web.</p>

<p>After I graduated, I got a job as a front-end developer working mostly in <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular 2+</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, but that didn‚Äôt stop my attempts at game development. I participated in GGJ 2017 and 2018 with some other friends and while none of the games we‚Äôve created made it to Steam, I‚Äôve learned a lot about developing projects in <strong>Unity</strong>. That led to a project called <strong>Super Rumble</strong> that was a simple tech demo I made with my friend (more on that later).</p>
<p>On <strong>July 26th 2019</strong> I started working on a next project - an isometric RPG inspired by first two Fallout games, but set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world codenamed <strong>Project Labrador</strong>. It‚Äôs all made in in <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. Sometimes getting things done overwhelms me (mostly because of badly designed parts of the code that make me want to shoot myself while adding new features), but I try to keep going regularly - with shorter or longer breaks just to not go insane, as there‚Äôs no deadline for me after all. However the scope keeps growing and growing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs my story. Somehow I became a game developer that works on his solo project a lot. But I‚Äôve talked enough - more details about the project and my thoughts on different technology-related topics will be coming soon. I hope you liked what I‚Äôve written - be sure to check my blog regularly. </p>
<p>Bye for now!</p>
